MSDChallenge
============

Abstract 
--------

MSDChallenge is music recommendation engine created for the Million Song Dataset challenge. 
It offers, considering a log listening history ,for a specific user a set of recommended songs.

We focused on a collaborative filtering approach based on the content, "Item-based Collaborative Filtering" (CF), because this approach is able to handle large data sets efficiently. 

We also studied functions for target similarities between songs, assigning scores for each song (using these functions) and the recommendation of songs for a user.
